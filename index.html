            <p>When you think about Russian food, pelmeni are probably the first dish that comes to mind. Pelmeni are
               bite-sized dumplings made with ground meat (usually beef or lamb), that are boiled and then most commonly
               served with sour cream (though they can come as a soup or served with butter, mustard, or vinegar).
               Though
               pelmeni have made most traditionally in the Ural Mountains for over 600 years, this dish is famous across
               Russia and beyond. Try a bowl of pelmeni in soup, topped with a dollop of thick sour cream and a
               sprinkling
               of dill.

            <h3>Russian Borscht</h3>

            <p>There is a Borscht joke that says that if you put a spoon in it, and it stands – you did it right.
               Borscht is a beet soup that originated in Ukraine and was quickly adopted as a Russian specialty. Beets
               may seem like a strange base for soup to many Westerners, but there are plenty of reasons that this
               hearty soup is one of Russia's most famous dishes. It is full of meat and sautéed vegetables, including
               cabbage, carrots, onions, and potatoes. It can be served hot or cold and is best served with a dollop of
               fresh sour cream on top.

            <p>Beef stroganoff consists of sauteed beef strips served in a creamy sauce with mushrooms or tomatoes,
               often served with rice, noodles, or potatoes. This recipe has a long history, and many variations for its
               preparation exist, but its roots are in mid-19th-century Russia.

            <h3>Pirozhki</h3>

               <figcaption>Pirozhki in Russian &xrarr; Пирожки</figcaption>

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <p>Soft as a pillow, caramelized on the edges and stuffed with rich fillings; Russian pirozhki are
               dangerously moreish. In fact in the 1950's, one opportunistic Japanese chef decided to capitalize on the
               deliciousness of pirozhki, by pretending that it was his original invention. Hazuo Tomita managed to
               patent the pies and earned a pretty pile of money from the royalties of Japanese pie-sellers till some
               Russian found out and called the bluff. The ensuing court case involved one of the highest numbers of
               witnesses in history. Six hundred people in total were called upon to testify to the Russian origins of
               the humble pirozhok! Some things never change; in our era of KFC and hamburgers, pirozhki are still the
               go to fast food for Russians. All over the country, from the wide avenues of Moscow to the dirt roads of
               regional Russia, the smell of gently frying pirozhki seeps out in tantalizing wafts from food trucks and
               hole-in-the-wall bakeries.

            <p>Meat jelly, or aspic, has been a staple around the world for centuries, and is a popular dish served with
               salads or as an appetizer. Certain cuts of meat contain a lot of gelatin, and so these parts are boiled
               overnight, and the resulting liquid is mixed with meat and vegetables and cooled to a solid. Try
               kholodets with carrots, garlic, and boiled egg as an appetizer before your meal.
